    <h1>Here is the MadLib for you</h1>

    <p>Today I went to the zoo. I saw a(n) @Model.Adjective1 @Model.Noun1 jumping up and down in its tree. </p> 
    <p>He @Model.Adverb1, through the large tunnel that led to its @Model.Adjective2 @Model.Noun2. </p>
    <p>I got some peanuts and passed them through the cage to a gigantic gray @Model.Noun3 towering above my head.</p>
    <p>Feeding that animal made me hungry. </p>
    <p>I went to get a @Model.Adjective3 scoop of ice cream. </p>
    <p>It filled my stomach.</p>
    <p>Afterwards I had to @Model.VerbPT2 @Model.Adverb2 catch our bus. </p>
    <p>When I got home I @Model.VerbPT1 my mom for a @Model.Adjective4 day at the zoo. </p>
